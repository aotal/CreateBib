abstract = {PURPOSE: According to the GYN GEC-ESTRO Recommendations, MRI is needed with the modality of T2 weighted. CT-MR compatible tandem plus colpostats (T/C) (Nucletron) is widely used in cervical brachytherapy. The major challenge of MRI is the lack of dummy catheters. Therefore, an additional imaging modality is usually required. One disadvantage of sliced-based reconstruction is that resolution in longitudinal directions can be affected by the slice thickness. The aim of this study is to present a modified T/C applicator in which the catheter visibility is significantly improved. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A modification to the existing T/C applicator has been made available, increasing the catheter entrance diameter. It allows a greater dummy catheter diameter, and consequently it can be filled with more material per unit length. Visibility was studied with different materials. RESULTS: The catheter filled with saline water plus iodine compound was clearly seen in both axial and longitudinal acquisitions. To avoid uncertainties introduced by the slice thickness, a simple procedure is presented using longitudinal acquisitions. CONCLUSIONS: The modified applicator plus catheter allows a powerful signal in T2 weighted MRI, using a very simple and accessible material. Also, a method is proposed to solve the problem of the uncertainty derived from slice thickness using few longitudinal acquisitions.},
