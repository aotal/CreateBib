abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nasal vestibular cancers are rare entities among the head and neck cancers. The treatment options are varied. Although surgical treatment plays an important role, postablative defects are difficult to reconstruct. This review aims to discuss the current views in the management of these cancers and issues related to the reconstruction of the complex surgical defects. RECENT FINDINGS: Nasal vestibular cancers are a distinct rare entity of head and neck cancers. These cancers are staged using the AJCC-TNM system for nonmelanoma cutaneous cancers of head and neck or the Wang classification. Early lesions are best treated by either surgery or radiation giving excellent cure rates. Advanced stages tumours need combined treatment with surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. Primary radiation therapy can be offered by external beam or interstitial brachytherapy. Surgical treatment varies from endonasal resections, Mohs' chemosurgery to open excisions. SUMMARY: Even though the Wang system of classification is used by majority of reports due its clinical utility, it has a drawback of not taking into account the tumour size as done by the AJCC system. Brachytherapy has been reported to be offering excellent cure rates with low morbidity in early tumours. Surgical treatment is also effective in early lesions, but its role is more established in advanced lesions. Reconstruction of the surgical defects is often a challenge, to preserve functional integrity and cosmesis. Various techniques, including skin grafts, local flaps, free flaps and prosthetics, form part of the reconstructive armamentarium.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a method combining CT scout images with axial images to improve the localization accuracy of catheter tips in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT scout images were utilized along with conventionally reconstructed axial images to aid the localization of catheter tips used during HDR treatment planning. A method was developed to take advantage of the finer image resolution of the scout images to more precisely identify the tip coordinates. The accuracies of this method were compared with the conventional method based on the axial CT images alone, for various slice thicknesses, in a computed tomography dose index (CTDI) head phantom. A clinical case which involved multiple interstitial catheters was also selected for the evaluation of this method. Locations of the catheter tips were reconstructed with the conventional CT-based method and this newly developed method, respectively. Location coordinates obtained via both methods were quantitatively compared. RESULTS: Combination of the scout and axial CT images improved the accuracy of identification and reconstruction of catheter tips along the longitudinal direction (i.e., head-to-foot direction, more or less parallel to the catheter tracks), compared to relying on the axial CT images alone. The degree of improvement was dependent on CT slice thickness. For the clinical patient case, the coordinate differences of the reconstructed catheter tips were 2.6 mm ± 0.9 mm in the head-to-foot direction, 0.4 mm ± 0.2 mm in the left-to-right direction, and 0.6 mm ± 0.2 mm in the anterior-to-posterior direction, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining CT scout and axial images demonstrates the ability to provide a more accurate identification and reconstruction of the interstitial catheter tips for HDR brachytherapy treatment, especially in the longitudinal direction. The method developed in this work has the potential to be implemented clinically together with automatic segmentation in modern brachytherapy treatment planning systems, in order to improve the reconstruction accuracy of HDR catheters.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We developed a novel and simple method to measure the source positions in applicators directly for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy based on Cherenkov emission imaging, and evaluated the performance. METHODS: The light emission from plastic applicators used in cervical cancer treatments, irradiated by an <sup>192</sup> Ir γ-ray source, was captured using a charge-coupled device camera. Moreover, we attached plastics of different shapes, including tapes, tubes, and plates to a metal applicator, to use as screens for the Cherenkov imaging. We determined the source positions and dwell intervals from the light profiles along with the applicator and compared these with preset values and dummy marker measurements. RESULTS: The source positions and dwell intervals measured from the light images were comparable to the dummy marker measurements and preset values. The distance from the applicator tip to the first source positions agreed with the dummy marker measurements within 0.2 mm for the plastic tandem. The dwell intervals measured using the Cherenkov method agreed with the preset values within 0.6 mm. The distances measured with three plastic types on the metal applicator also agreed with the dummy marker measurements within 0.2 mm. The dwell intervals measured using the plastic tape agreed with the preset values within 0.7 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method should be suitable for rapid and easy quality assurance (QA) investigations in HDR brachytherapy, as it enables source position using a single image. The method allows for real-time, filmless measurements of the source positions to be obtained and is useful for rapid feedback in QA procedures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The PORTEC-4a trial investigates molecular-integrated risk profile guided adjuvant treatment for endometrial cancer. The quality assurance programme included a dummy run for vaginal brachytherapy prior to site activation, and annual quality assurance to verify protocol adherence. Aims of this study were to evaluate vaginal brachytherapy quality and protocol adherence. METHODS: For the dummy run, institutes were invited to create a brachytherapy plan on a provided CT-scan with the applicator in situ. For annual quality assurance, institutes provided data of one randomly selected brachytherapy case. A brachytherapy panel reviewed and scored the brachytherapy plans according to a checklist. RESULTS: At the dummy run, 15 out of 21 (71.4%) institutes needed adjustments of delineation or planning. After adjustments, the mean dose at the vaginal apex (protocol: 100%; 7 Gy) decreased from 100.7% to 99.9% and range and standard deviation (SD) narrowed from 83.6-135.1 to 96.4-101.4 and 8.8 to 1.1, respectively. At annual quality assurance, 22 out of 27 (81.5%) cases had no or minor and 5 out of 27 (18.5%) major deviations. Most deviations were related to delineation, mean dose at the vaginal apex (98.0%, 74.7-114.2, SD 7.6) or reference volume length. CONCLUSIONS: Most feedback during the brachytherapy quality assurance procedure of the PORTEC-4a trial was related to delineation, dose at the vaginal apex and the reference volume length. Annual quality assurance is essential to promote protocol compliance, ensuring high quality vaginal brachytherapy in all participating institutes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of dwell position detection with a combined electromagnetic tracking (EMT) brachytherapy (BT) system for treatment verification, by quantifying positional errors due to EM field interference in typical pelvic BT clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dedicated prostate and cervix BT phantoms were imaged with CT. For the cervix phantom, the Utrecht applicator + interstitial catheters were used. The implants were reconstructed and treatment plans were created with 270/65 dwell positions for the prostate/cervix phantom. Next, EMT experiments were performed in clinical BT settings using a prototype of a combined EMT/BT system. We quantified positional errors due to EM field interference from surrounding equipment by comparing planned and EMT-measured dwell positions. The mean residual error between planned and EMT-measured dwell positions was calculated in the prostate interstitial catheters and in the whole cervix implant including the applicator. For the cervix phantom, the analysis was repeated for only the interstitial catheters. RESULTS: Mean residual errors of less than 0.5/0.4 mm in the prostate/cervix catheters were found. For the whole cervix implant including the applicator, large deviations up to 2.4 mm were found. Compared to the interference free set-up, the CT and patient bed environments showed larger residual errors in the interstitial catheters, but residual errors remained <1 mm in all cases. CONCLUSION: Dwell position detection with the combined system in interstitial catheters is sufficiently accurate to perform EMT-based treatment verification. The effect of EM interference from the surrounding equipment was limited.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic review of relevant studies was performed through the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases through May 10, 2020. Articles reporting on IC/IS technology, volumetric doses to high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs), tumor control and/or treatment-related side effects were identified. The key information, including the type of applicator, implantation technology, characteristics of implantation, volumetric doses, tumor control, and/or treatment-related side effects, was extracted. A probit model analysis between HR-CTV D90 and tumor local control was performed. RESULTS: Twelve studies encompassing 520 patients were included in the probit model between HR-CTV D90 and the local control rate. The probit model showed a significant relationship between the HR-CTV D90 value and the local control probability, p = 0.003. The prescribed dose of 85 Gy<sub>EQD2,10</sub> would in theory warrant an 87.4% (95% confidence interval 82.5%-90.5%) local control rate. CONCLUSION: IC/IS BT is an appropriate method to achieve a high therapeutic ratio for tumors with large volumes or poor responses after external irradiation in cervical cancer. The probit model showed that the dose escalation of HR-CTV D90 was helpful to improve the local tumor control rate.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare catheter reconstruction methods for lunar ovoid channels of the Venezia<sup>TM</sup> advanced gynecological applicator (Elekta, Sweden). Material and methods: Three available lunar ovoid sizes (22, 26, and 30 mm effective diameter) were evaluated. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed with a dummy wire inserted and with the Flexitron<sup>®</sup> source position simulator (SPS) at step sizes of 5 mm from the most distal dwell position. Treatment plans were generated in Oncentra<sup>®</sup> (version 4.5.3) with different catheter reconstruction techniques: centerline reconstruction, tracing a CT dummy wire, using a source path model provided by Elekta, and using the SPS at each planning dwell position. Source position agreement was assessed in registered CT images, and dose differences were calculated with the SPS-based treatment plan as a reference. Finally, dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were evaluated for clinical plans with the Venezia<sup>TM</sup> applicator. Results: For the most distal dwell position, the manufacturer's model had the closest agreement with the SPS at 0.6 ±0.3 mm across applicator sizes. Relative to the SPS, maximal dose differences outside of the applicator were between 16-39% for a 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> volume and 3.6-9.1% for a 2.0 cm<sup>3</sup> volume. For two clinical plans, volume-based DVH parameters agreed ≤ 3.9%, while deviations ≤ 5.3% were seen for point metrics. Conclusions: Relative to the SPS-based plan, large local dose discrepancies were reduced, but not eliminated, using the manufacturer's source path model. The choice of reconstruction technique was found to have relatively limited impact on DVH parameters for regions outside of the vaginal mucosa.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast enabling the contouring of targets and organs at risk (OARs) during gynecological interstitial brachytherapy procedure. Despite its benefit, one of the main challenges toward MRI-only workflows is that the implanted catheters are not reliably visualized on MR images. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of MR-only workflow using an in-house MR line marker during interstitial gynecological high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients diagnosed with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with HDR brachytherapy were included in this study. The hybrid CT/MR-treated plan was used as the study reference plan. Five users manually reconstructed the catheter's path on MR images (3D T1- and T2-weighted). Subsequently, the dwell positions from the users' plans were superimposed on the reference plans to evaluate the dosimetric impact of the using MR-only for catheter reconstruction in comparison with hybrid CT/MR approach. Variability of dwell positions between users and reconstruction time was also evaluated. RESULTS: More than 96.90% of catheter reconstruction variations were < 2 mm. No statistical differences were reported between MR-only and hybrid CT/MR in gross tumor volume D<sub>98</sub> and high-risk clinical target volume D<sub>90</sub>, respectively. For the OARs (bladder, sigmoid, rectum, and bowel), no significant changes were observed in any dose metrics between MR-only and hybrid CT/MR. The average reconstruction time was 51 ± 10 minutes across all ten patients. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of MR-only workflow using MR line marker during interstitial gynecological HDR brachytherapy has been validated in this study. The results show that the MR-only workflow is equivalent to the conventional hybrid CT/MR approach in terms of gross tumor volume and high-risk clinical target volume coverage and respecting of OARs dose limits.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five phantom material combinations were tested and evaluated for material characteristics; Ecoflex 00-30 silicone, emulsion silicone with 20% or 50% mineral oil, and regular or supersoft polyvinyl chloride (PVC). A prostate phantom which includes an anatomic simulated prostate, urethra, seminal vesicles, rectum, and normal surrounding tissue was created with 3D-printed molds using 20% emulsion silicone and regular and supersoft PVC materials based on speed of sound testing. Needle artifact retention was evaluated at weekly intervals. RESULTS: Speed of sound testing demonstrated PVC to have the closest ultrasound characteristics of the materials tested to that of soft tissue. Several molds were created with 3D-printed PLA directly or cast on 3D-printed PLA with high heat resistant silicone. The prostate phantom fabrication workflow was developed, including a method to produce dummy seeds for low-dose-rate brachytherapy practice. A complete phantom may be fabricated in 1.5-2 h, and the material cost for each phantom was approximated at $23.98. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost and reusable phantom was developed based on 3D-printed molds for casting.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Eliminating patient computed tomography (CT) scans for tandem and ring (T&R) brachytherapy can reduce overall procedure time and eliminates imaging dose. However, reconstructing titanium applicators in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging. We evaluated the uncertainty of different applicator reconstruction workflows in MR-guided brachytherapy, and assessed the clinical impact of reconstruction uncertainties. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Titanium MRI-compatible T&Rs with aqueous gel in the buildup cap were reconstructed on CTs and MRIs to assess the uncertainties of four different workflows. Reconstruction was performed using (1) proton density-weighted MRIs with solid applicator from a library, (2) applicator-only reference CT fused with MRIs, (3) T2-weighted (T2W) MRIs following GEC-ESTRO guidelines, and (4) patient CTs fused with patient MRIs with in situ applicators. We evaluated dwell positions and plan quality differences using high-risk clinical target volume coverage, and EQD2 D<sub>2cc</sub> of rectum, sigmoid, bladder, and small bowel. RESULTS: The 2σ uncertainty for dwell positions for each workflow were (1) 2.7 mm for both ring and tandem, (2) 1.4 mm ring and 0.8 mm tandem, (3) 0.2 mm ring and 0.8 mm tandem, and (4) 1.9 mm ring and 0.4 mm tandem. Reconstruction uncertainties resulted in dose variations within acceptable levels (below 10%) except for (1) which resulted in larger dose to the rectum (20%). Dose uncertainties were similar between reference CT and patient CT. CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction with a reference CT results in similar uncertainty to a patient CT. T2W MRI plans have acceptable uncertainty levels for the applicator reconstruction and resulting dose distributions.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For all patients a treatment planning computed tomography (CT) and a follow-up CT were acquired and used for the retrospective evaluation. Keeping dwell time and dwell positions constant, the treatment plan assessed directly after catheter implantation was compared to the situation 48 h after implantation. Both manual catheter reconstructions, based on the planning and follow-up CT, were rigid registered to each other and the resulting deviations analyzed, like the difference between corresponding dwell positions (ΔDP) or the discrete Fréchet distance. Further, the dosimetric changes, e.g., coverage index (ΔCI), conformal index (ΔCOIN) and dose non-uniformity ratio (ΔDNR) were considered for a deformed planning target volume (PTV) and the rigid warped PTV structure. The PTV was deformed according to the vector field estimated between the two acquired CTs. RESULTS: Over all patients with rigid aligned CTs a mean ΔDP, ΔCI, ΔCOIN and ΔDNR were determined to 2.41 ± 1.73 mm, 3.10 ± 3.17%, 0.009 ± 0.007 and 0.036 ± 0.040, respectively. Considering the deformed PTV ΔCI was estimated to 5.05 ± 4.14%. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in 4% of the cases re-planning would have been beneficial to ensure the planned dose delivery. Large PTV changes or large DP deviations were found to be the main reasons for dosimetric variations.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Irradiation of the tumor bed using interstitial multi-catheter brachytherapy is one of the treatment options for breast cancer patients. In order to ensure the planned dose delivery an advanced quality intervention method using an electromagnetic tracking (EMT) system is presented. The system is used to assess inter-fractional variations within the framework of a patient study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Until now 41 patients were included in the study for the evaluation and overall 355 EMT measurements were performed. The catheter traces are measured automatically and sequentially using an afterloader prototype (Flexitron, Elekta, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) equipped with an EMT sensor. The implant geometry is tracked directly after implantation, after CT imaging and after each irradiation fraction. The acquired data is rigidly registered to the catheter traces defined in the treatment plan and the dwell positions (DP) are reconstructed. DPs defined in treatment planning serve as reference. Breathing motion was corrected and recorded using three reference 6DoF sensors placed on the patients' skin. The Euclidean distance between the planned and reconstructed DPs provides information about possible inter-fractional deviations. Further, the influence of various factors on the occurrence of large deviations was investigated, like the patients' age, the length of the catheter, the breast volume, etc. RESULTS: Over all patient measurements a median Euclidean distance of 2.19 mm was determined between the reconstructed DPs and the reference DPs. The median deviation combining all datasets was minimal (1.67 mm) at the measurement directly after CT imaging. The deviations between the different fractions have a median distance of 2.31 mm which could be improved to 2.05 mm by adapting the treatment plan according to the follow-up CT. No correlation between the distance to the skin, ribs, mammilla or the breast volume and the occurrences of large deviations was found. The largest deviations were determined in the upper inner quadrant of the breast. CONCLUSION: The afterloader prototype could be well integrated into the clinical routine and is beneficial for ensuring the quality of the brachytherapy. Overall, a small median DP deviation, lower than the used step size of 2.5 mm, was detected.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The MRI-guided cervical cancer brachytherapy provides unparalleled soft-tissue contrast for target and normal tissue contouring, but eliminates the ability to use conventional metallic fiducials for radiation source path reconstruction as required for treatment planning. Instead, the source path is reconstructed by manually aligning a library model to the signal void produced by the applicator, which takes time intraoperatively and precludes fully automated treatment planning. The purpose of this study is to present and validate an algorithm to automatically reconstruct tandem and ring applicators using MRI for cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. METHODS: Applicators were reconstructed using T2-weighted MR images acquired at 1.5 T from 33 brachytherapy fractions including 10 patients using a model-to-image registration algorithm. The algorithm involves (a) image filtering and maximum intensity projection to highlight the applicator, (b) ring center identification using the circular Hough transform, and (c) three-dimensional surface model registration, optimized by maximizing the image intensity gradient normal to the model surface. Two independent observers manually reconstructed all applicators, enabling the calculation of interobserver variability and establishing a ground truth. Algorithm variability was calculated by comparing algorithm results to each individual observer, and algorithm accuracy was calculated by comparing algorithm results to the ground truth. The algorithm variability and accuracy were compared to the interobserver variability using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Mean ± SD interobserver variability was 0.83 ± 0.31 mm and 0.78 ± 0.29 mm for the ring and tandem, respectively. The algorithm had mean ± SD variability and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.32 mm (P = 0.02) and 0.60 ± 0.24 mm (P = 0.0005) for the ring, and 0.70 ± 0.29 mm (P = 0.11) and 0.58 ± 0.24 mm (P = 0.004) for the tandem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm variability and accuracy were within the interobserver variability measured in this study. The algorithm accuracy and mean execution time of 10.0 s are sufficient for clinical tandem and ring reconstruction, and are a step toward fully automated tandem and ring brachytherapy treatment planning.},

abstract = {Background: The optimal treatment for regional lymphatic recurrences from head and neck cancer has not been fully established. In order to explore the therapeutic benefit of surgical resection and adjuvant brachytherapy, the authors reviewed their experience utilizing interstitial brachytherapy (IBT) at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Methods: A retrospective chart review of the 51 patients who received salvage surgical resection of lymphatic recurrences and adjuvant IBT between 1993 and 2012 at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center was undertaken. All patients underwent neck dissection with complete resection and intraoperative placement of afterloading brachytherapy catheters. Soft tissue reconstruction was performed as necessary. The technical aspects of IBT were reviewed, and the overall and disease free survival rates and the recurrence rates were determined. Results: All patients had received external beam radiation (EBRT) as part of their initial treatment to a median dose of 66 Gy; 40 and 68% of the patients also had a neck dissection or chemotherapy, respectively. The cumulative regional recurrence probability is 28 and 38% at 5 years and 10 years. All of the patients underwent salvage neck dissection and IBT, with 81% also undergoing soft tissue reconstruction. The median dose delivered to the tumor bed was 60 Gy over a median duration of 4.5 days. There were 21 early adverse events, 8 of which were severe, and 19 late adverse events, 6 of which were severe. The most common early and late adverse events due to surgery and brachytherapy were dysphagia (7.1%) and true vocal cord paralysis (17.9%), respectively. There were no perioperative deaths or carotid hemorrhages. Nineteen patients developed recurrence including regional recurrence and distinct metastasis. The median time to recurrence is 130 months using Kaplan-Meier product limit method. The 2-year disease-free survival rate was 58%. The 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival rates were 69, 56, and 46%, respectively. Conclusions: Regional recurrences in previously irradiated tissues after the definitive treatment of primary head and neck cancers represent a challenging problem. We demonstrated that salvage neck dissection with IBT provided encouraging regional control and survival rates, while maintaining relatively low acute and long-term toxicity rates.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The lack of positive contrast from brachytherapy seeds in conventional MR images remains a major challenge toward an MRI-only workflow for postimplant dosimetry of low-dose-rate brachytherapy. In this work, the feasibility of our recently proposed MRI-only workflow in clinically relevant scenarios is investigated and the necessary modifications in image acquisition and processing pipeline are proposed for transition to the clinic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four prostate phantoms with a total of 321 I-125 implanted dummy seeds and three patients with a total of 168 implanted seeds were scanned using a gradient echo sequence on 1.5 T and 3T MR scanners. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was performed for seed visualization. Before QSM, the seed-induced distortion correction was performed followed by edge enhancement. Seed localization was performed using spatial clustering algorithms and was compared with CT. In addition, feasibility of the proposed method on detection of prostatic calcifications was studied. RESULTS: The proposed susceptibility-based algorithm generated consistent positive contrast for the seeds in phantoms and patients. All the 321 seeds in the four phantoms were correctly identified; the MR-derived seeds centroids agreed well with CT-derived positions (average error = 0.5 ± 0.3 mm). The proposed algorithm for seed visualization was found to be orientation invariant. In patient cases, all seeds were visualized and correctly localized (average error = 1.2 ± 0.9 mm); no significant differences between dose volume histogram parameters were found. Prostatic calcifications were depicted with negative contrast on QSM and spatially agreed with CT. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MRI-based approach has great potential to replace the current CT-based practices. Additional patient studies are necessary to further optimize and validate the workflow.},

This study mechanically evaluated the Bravos system precision and accuracy for clinically relevant scenarios, using dummy sources. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The system was evaluated after three sets of experiments: (1) The CamScale was used to verify inter- and intra-channel dwelling variability and system calibration; (2) A high-speed camera was used to verify the source simulation cable movement inside a transparent quality assurance device, where dwell positions, dwell times, transit times, speed profiles, and accelerations were measured; (3) The source movement inside clinical applicators was captured with an imaging panel while being exposed to an external kV source. Measured and planned dwell positions and times were compared. RESULTS: Maximum deviations between planned and measured dwell positions and times for the source cable were 0.4 mm for the CamScale measurements and 0.07 seconds for the high-speed camera measurements. Mean dwell position deviations inside clinical applicators were below 1.2 mm for all applicators except the ring that required an offset correction of 1 mm to achieve a mean deviation of 0.4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Features of the Bravos afterloader system provide a robust and precise treatment delivery. All measurements were within manufacturer specifications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (PRT/PCRT) represent an increasingly used clinical strategy in different tumor sites. We have previously reported on a PRT/PRCT protocol in patients with locally advanced non-inflammatory breast cancer (LABC) with promising clinical results. However, concerns regarding a possible unfavorable influence on cosmesis still exist. Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine long-term cosmetic outcome in our series of LABC patients treated with PRT/PCRT followed by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy (ME). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 315 patients treated with PRT/PCRT in the years 1991 to 1999, 203 were still alive at long-term follow-up of mean 17.7 years (range 14-21). Thirty-seven patients were lost to follow-up and 58 patients refused to be contacted, which resulted in 107 patients (64 patients after BCS and 43 after mastectomy) being available and willing to undergo further cosmetic assessment. One patient had a complete response after PRT/PCRT and refused surgery. PRT/PCRT consisted of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with 50 Gy (5 × 2 Gy/week) to the breast and the supra-/infraclavicular lymph nodes combined with a consecutive electron boost or (in case of BCS) a 10-Gy interstitial brachytherapy boost with Ir-192 prior to EBRT. Overall, chemotherapy was administered either prior to RT or concomitantly in the majority of patients. BCS and mastectomy were performed with and without reconstruction. The cosmetic outcome was assessed by patient questionnaire, panel evaluation, and breast retraction assessment (BRA) score. RESULTS: Eighty percent of all BCS patients rated their overall cosmetic result as "excellent" or "good" as compared to 55.8% after mastectomy. Patient and panel ratings on cosmetic outcomes were similar between the two groups. No grade III or IV fibrosis were detected in any of the groups. The median BRA score after breast conserving surgery was 2.9. CONCLUSION: PRT/PCRT is associated with low grades of fibrosis and a good to excellent long-term cosmetic outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brachytherapy involves placement of radioactive sources inside or near the tumour. For gynaecological cancer, recent developments, including 3D imaging and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy, have improved treatment quality and outcomes. However, for large or complex tumours, target coverage and local control with commercially available applicators remain suboptimal. Moreover, side effects are frequent and impact on quality of life. This signifies that brachytherapy treatment conformity can improve. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop 3D printed personalised brachytherapy applicators with a custom vaginal topography and guided needle source channels, based on the patients' anatomy. METHODS: Customised applicators were derived from MRI data of two gynaecological cancer patients. Needle channels were planned by the Radiation Oncologist during image segmentation. Applicators contained multi-curved channels for 6F needles (ProGuide, Elekta) and were manufactured using a digital light processing-based 3D printer. Needle channel radius constraints were measured by analysing needle insertion forces in a 3D printed template, and imposed on the designs. RESULTS: Two customised needle applicators are presented. Interstitial needle channels have tapered ends to increase needle protrusion angle accuracy. Additional structures were included to serve as anchor points in MR images for applicator and needle modelling and reconstruction during treatment planning. An insertion force analysis yielded a radius constraint of 35 mm to minimise the risk on needle jamming or buckling. For radii larger than 50 mm, no differences in insertion forces were found. CONCLUSION: A novel method to design and produce vaginal topography-based 3D prints for personalised brachytherapy applicators, derived from patient MRI data, is presented. The applicators include curved needle channels that can be used for intracavitary and guided interstitial needle placement. Further spatial optimisation of brachytherapy source channels to the patient anatomy is expected to increase brachytherapy conformity and outcome.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review scientific literature on the use of intensity-modulated brachytherapy (IMBT), including static and dynamic shielding approaches, to enhance therapeutic ratio. Studies were evaluated for technique, disease site, dosimetry, applicators, dosimetric calculations, and planning algorithms. Comparisons with standard-of-care brachytherapy techniques, alternative IMBT methods, or both were performed for dose-to-target volumes, organs at risk (OARs), and treatment planning or delivery times. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Inclusion criteria were any peer-reviewed journal articles on IMBT published from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 2019, on PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO databases. Two independent investigators reviewed each article for inclusion and exclusion criteria and scope. Data collected on each study included technique, source or shield material, disease site, n of study (n = number of simulated plans/treated patients), dose-to-target/OARs, and planning or delivery times. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA). RESULTS: Database queries yielded 1734 results, which were reduced to 436 after exclusion criteria and 78 peer-reviewed journal articles after evaluation of scope. Studies per disease site were 31 for cervical; 16 for rectal; 10 for oculocutaneous; 7 for breast; 6 for prostate; and 8 for other, multiple, or no specific disease site. Eighteen studies demonstrated a significant decrease in dose to OARs (5.1%-68.2%), 11 improved treatment planning or delivery times (7.6%-99.7%), and 6 increased target coverage (18.6%-71.6%) relative to standard-of-care or alternative IMBT technique. IMBT consistently decreased dose to OAR compared with the standard of care at the cost of increased planning or delivery times. Innovations in dose calculation or planning algorithms and applicators were capable of ameliorating prolonged treatment intervals. CONCLUSIONS: IMBT techniques improved the therapeutic ratio by reducing OAR doses, facilitating dose escalation, or both. Static-shielding techniques are clinically available as a result of the advent of commercially available heterogeneity-corrected dose-calculation algorithms, whereas dynamic-shielding techniques are still preclinical.},

Material and methods: Twenty lip cancer patients were treated from January 2012 to September 2016. Primary treatment included surgery with or without reconstruction. All patients were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, most of the tumors were pT1. Brachytherapy procedures were done after post-operative wound healing. Median of three plastic tubes were implanted using a free-hand technique. Two PDR-BT treatments were scheduled for every patient, with the gap of median 13 days. The planned dose was 0.8-1 Gy per pulse to the total dose of 50 Gy from two PDR-BT treatments. Patients were evaluated every 3-6 months. Follow-up time was counted from the last day of treatment to any event or last visit. Early and late toxicities were scored with RTOG scale. Results: Average follow-up was 34.7 months (range, 12.7-67.6). Three- and five-year estimated disease-free survival was 95% and local control was 100%. One patient suffered from regional relapse in the submental region (IA lymph node group). Skin erythema or dry desquamation (grade 1) or wet desquamation (grade 2) was observed in 13 patients (65%) and one patient (5%), respectively. Six patients presented no acute toxicity. Moreover, there were no complications involving lip mucosa. All patients had grade 1 soft tissue fibrosis in the irradiated area, besides that, late toxicity included only skin complications. There were no significant factors associated with late toxicity ≥ grade 2. Conclusions: PDR-BT in the adjuvant treatment of the lip cancer yields high local control with low toxicity. Even patients with close margins after surgery (< 5 mm) should be considered as candidates for PDR-BT.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate inter- and intra-observer variabilities of catheter reconstruction and its dosimetric impact for multi-catheter interstitial breast cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In order to evaluate inter-observer variabilities (IOV) three medical physicists reconstructed the catheter traces of 13 patients. These manual reconstructions were further compared to the automatic reconstruction algorithm integrated into the planning system and one on purpose imprecise manual reconstruction. For intra-observer variabilities (IAV) repeated reconstructions of two physicists were compared for 13 patients. In total 426 catheters were considered. Keeping dwell times, dwell positions, the optimization and the normalization relative points constant the geometrical deviations between the corresponding dwell positions of the reference data set and the investigated reconstructions were evaluated. Also, the effect on the quality indices, such as coverage index (CI), dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR) or conformal index (COIN), and the exposure of the organs at risk were analyzed. RESULTS: Over all patients and all different catheter reconstructions considered for IOV a mean deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.60 ± 0.35 mm was detected. The first observer had a mean deviation of 0.54 ± 0.32 mm, whereas the second observer yielded a mean deviation of 0.58 ± 0.37 mm. The length of the catheter traces varied in the mean by 0.51 ± 0.45 mm. The mean relative deviation of the CI, DNR, COIN, mean heart dose and mean lung dose varied by 0.27 ± 0.31%, 0.0027 ± 0.0025, 0.0036 ± 0.0033, 0.024 ± 0.019%, 0.05 ± 0.11%, respectively. The skin dose (D<sub>0.2ccm</sub>) changed in the maximum 8.52%. On average IAV reached a deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.49 ± 0.30 mm. IOVs and IAVs proved to be significantly different (Wilcoxon's test p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The study proved that a repeated reconstruction of the catheter traces does not lead to large geometrical deviations or to a significant change in the dose exposure. But the lack of ground truth makes the estimation of the quality of the reconstruction challenging. A precise reconstruction mapping the reality is a necessity for the planned dose delivery. With all considered reconstruction techniques reliable quality indices for the target and the organs at risk could be obtained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The EMBRACE II study combines state-of-the-art Image-Guided Adaptive Brachytherapy in cervix cancer with an advanced protocol for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) which specifies target volume selection, contouring and treatment planning. In EMBRACE II, well-defined EBRT is an integral part of the overall treatment strategy with the primary aim of improving nodal control and reducing morbidity. The EMBRACE II EBRT planning concept is based on improved conformality through relaxed coverage criteria for all target volumes. For boosting of lymph nodes, a simultaneous integrated boost and coverage probability planning is applied. Before entering EMBRACE II, institutes had to go through accreditation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As part of accreditation, a treatment planning dummy-run included educational blocks and submission of an examination case provided by the study coordinators. Seventy-one centers submitted 123 EBRT dose distributions. Replanning was required if hard constraints were violated or planning concepts were not fully accomplished. Dosimetric parameters of original and revised plans were compared. RESULTS: Only 11 plans violated hard constraints. Twenty-seven centers passed after first submission. 27 needed one and 13 centers needed more revisions. The most common reasons for revisions were low conformality, relatively high OAR doses or insufficient lymph node coverage reduction. Individual feedback on planning concepts improved plan quality considerably, resulting in a median body V43Gy reduction of 158 cm<sup>3</sup> from first plan submission to approved plan. CONCLUSION: A dummy-run as applied in EMBRACE II, consisting of training and examination cases enabled us to test institutes' treatment planning capabilities, and improve plan quality.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of computer-assisted techniques in the interstitial brachytherapy of the deep regions of the head and neck. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer-assisted brachytherapy workflow was applied to 10 patients with tumors in the deep regions of the head and neck. Based on the brachytherapy treatment preplan, we constructed a digital stereotactic model to accurately transfer the virtual plan into the navigation system, and subsequently printed the individual templates. The navigation system and the individual template were combined together to visualize and guide brachytherapy needle implantation. Preoperative and intraoperative image data were reconstructed and registered to measure and analyze the needle deviation. RESULTS: A total of 58 needles were successfully inserted in 10 patients with the guidance of computer-assisted techniques and a mean deviation of 5.2 mm. The inserting trajectories and depths of the needles were as follows: from the parotid and masseter regions to the infratemporal fossa or skull base, the range was 15.7-74.6 mm; from the submandibular and retromandibular regions to the infratemporal fossa or skull base, the range was 15.6-70.6 mm; from the infraorbital region to the pterygomandibular region, the range was 63.7-69.7 mm; and from the periorbital region to the intraorbital region, the range was 47.6-61.8 mm. The dose distribution met the treatment requirement well. CONCLUSIONS: The computer-assisted interstitial brachytherapy workflow was proven to be feasible and accurate for the deep regions of the head and neck.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of perioperative I-125 low-dose-rate brachytherapy mesh implantation in pelvic locations in an animal model, before applying it clinically. Material and methods: The animal model was the Romanov adult ewe. Non-radioactive dummy I-125 seeds were implanted by laparotomy in the pelvic area. Forty-five dummy seeds were placed on a 10 cm² polyglactin mesh to obtain a dose of 160 Gy at 5 mm from the center of each seed. Three CT scans were performed at day 15, day 70, and day 180 after surgery to check the positioning of the mesh for eventual seed migration according to bony landmarks and to perform a 3D theoretical dosimetric study. The experimental study design was based on Simon's minimax plan with a preliminary analysis of 10 ewes to validate the protocol and a second series of 7 ewes. Results: After the first step, 9 of 10 ewes were investigated. For 8 of 9 animals, the 160 Gy isodose line volume was within 10%, showing feasibility of the procedure and allowing 7 more to be added. At the end of the study, 16 of 17 animals were examined. No seeds loss was observed. The volume difference of the 160 Gy isodose line was within 10% in 13 of 16 ewes between the three CT scans. Twelve out of 16 had a coordinate deviation less than or equal to 10 mm on the three axes between the first and the third scans. Conclusions: These results show the technical feasibility of the pelvic mesh implantation in ewes. A phase I study for patients with locally advanced or recurrent pelvic tumors amenable to surgery, in combination with surgical resection should be possible.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Permanent seed brachytherapy is an established treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Currently, post-implant dosimetry is performed on CT images despite challenging target delineation due to limited soft tissue contrast. This work aims to develop an MRI-only workflow for post-implant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy seeds. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prostate mimicking phantom containing twenty stranded I-125 dummy seeds and calcifications was constructed. A three-dimensional gradient-echo MR sequence was employed on 3T and 1.5T MR scanners. An optimized quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique was applied to generate positive contrast for the seeds and calcifications. Seed numbers, centroids, and orientations were determined using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means and K-medoids clustering). The geometrical seed positions and the resulting dose distribution were compared to the clinical CT-based approach. RESULTS: The optimized QSM-based method generated high quality positive contrast for the seeds that were significantly different from that for calcifications and could be easily differentiated by thresholding. The estimated seed centroids from both 3T and 1.5T MR data were in perfect agreement with the standard CT-based seed detection algorithm (maximum difference of 0.7 mm). The estimated seed orientations were highly correlated with the actual orientations (R > 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MRI-based workflow enabling an accurate and robust means to localize the seeds (position and orientation) upon validation on complex seed configurations, has the potential to replace the current widely practiced CT-based workflow.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: For the purpose of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, a prototype magnetic resonance (MR) conditional afterloader was developed. This study demonstrates the development and testing of the prototype, while operating simultaneously with MRI. In combination with an MR-based method for HDR source localization, this development enables treatment verification of HDR brachytherapy. Additionally, this allows a direct reconstruction of the source dwell positions after catheter insertion (when using a dummy source) and introduction of a clinical workflow where the patient remains in the same position during dwell position reconstruction, treatment planning and irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prototype MR conditional afterloader was developed by providing radiofrequency (RF) shielding and a plastic source cable containing a dummy source. Simultaneous functioning of the afterloader and MRI acquisition was tested in an experimental setting where the afterloader was placed next to the scanner and programmed to send the source to predefined positions within a phantom, while acquiring MR images. The HDR source positions were determined using MR artifact simulation and matching of the MR images to the simulated artifact. Additionally, the impact of the presence and use of the afterloader on the MRI performance was investigated by assessment of RF interference, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and B<sub>0</sub> field homogeneity. RESULTS: The experiments demonstrated that the prototype MR conditional afterloader and the MRI scanner fully functioned while operating simultaneously, without influencing the other system. The step sizes between the source positions obtained from the MR images corresponded with the afterloader settings. Besides, the MRI performance tests demonstrated no deterioration due to the presence or functioning of the afterloader next to the scanner. CONCLUSIONS: This research has demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneous MR acquisition and employment of an MR conditional afterloader. This development enables real-time HDR source localization for treatment verification of MRI-guided HDR brachytherapy using an MR conditional afterloader.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the dose calculation accuracy in water medium of the Advanced Collapsed cone Engine (ACE) for three sizes of COMS eye plaques loaded with low-energy I-125 seeds. METHODS: A model of the Oncura 6711 I-125 seed was created for use with ACE in Oncentra<sup>®</sup> Brachy (OcB) using primary-scatter separated (PSS) point dose kernel and Task Group (TG) 43 datasets. COMS eye plaque models of diameters 12, 16, and 20 mm were introduced into the OcB applicator library based on 3D CAD drawings of the plaques and Silastic inserts. To perform TG-186 level 1 commissioning, treatment plans were created in OcB for a single source in water and for each COMS plaque in water for two scenarios: with only one centrally loaded seed, or with all seed positions loaded. ACE dose calculations were performed in high accuracy mode with a 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup> calculation grid. The resulting dose data were evaluated against Monte Carlo (MC) calculated doses obtained with MCNP6, using both local and global percent differences. RESULTS: ACE doses around the source for the single seed in water agreed with MC doses on average within < 5% inside a 6 × 6 × 6 cm<sup>3</sup> region, and within < 1.5% inside a 2 × 2 × 2 cm<sup>3</sup> region. The PSS data were generated at a higher resolution within 2 cm from the source, resulting in this improved agreement closer to the source due to fewer approximations in the ACE dose calculation. Average differences in both investigated plaque loading patterns in front of the plaques and on the plaque central axes were ≤ 2.5%, though larger differences (up to 12%) were found near the plaque lip. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, good agreement was found between ACE and MC dose calculations for a single I-125 seed and in front of the COMS plaques in water. More complex scenarios need to be investigated to determine how well ACE handles heterogeneous patient materials.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Recurring keloids are a clinical challenge. Interdisciplinary treatments are required in most cases. Owing to the wide variety of concepts, the optimal treatment regime remains unclear. Our clinic established a protocol of perioperative interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy with three fractions of 6 Gy and achieved an excellent 2-year local control rate of 94% (In search of the optimal treatment of keloids: Report of a series and a review of the literature). This report is an update on our long-term results of prospective study. Twenty-nine patients were included with a median followup of 5 years. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2009 to 2015, 29 patients with 37 recurrent keloids were treated with perioperative interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy; 3 patients had been previously treated with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy and presented with recurrences in the pretreated area. Brachytherapy was given in three fractions with a single dose of 6 Gy in 5-mm tissue depth and covered the scar in total length. Followup visits were scheduled at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. Therapeutic outcome was assessed in terms of recurrence, acute and late complications, and cosmetic results. RESULTS: No procedure-related complications occurred. Improvement of keloid-related symptoms was noticed in all patients after treatment. After a median followup of 49.7 months (range: 7.9-91.9 months), three keloid recurrences and two hypertrophied scars were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that brachytherapy may be advantageous in the management of high-risk keloids, even after failure of external beam radiotherapy and other treatment procedures. Our three-fraction treatment schedule reduces the treatment period to 2 days and is therefore convenient for the patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: During the partial-breast treatment course by interstitial brachytherapy, electromagnetic tracking (EMT) was applied to measure the implant geometry. Implant-geometry variation, choice of reference data, and three registration methods were assessed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The implant geometry was measured in 28 patients after catheter implantation (EMT<sub>bed</sub>), during CT imaging (EMT<sub>CT</sub>), and in each of up to n = 9 treatment fractions (EMT<sub>F(k), k = 1, 2,… n</sub>). EMT<sub>F(k)</sub> were registered to the planned implant reconstruction (CT<sub>plan</sub>) by using all dwell positions (DPs), the button centers, or three fiducial sensors on the patient's skin. Variation in implant geometry obtained from EMT<sub>F(k)</sub> was assessed for EMT<sub>bed,</sub> EMT<sub>CT</sub>, and CT<sub>plan</sub>. RESULTS: EMT was used to measure 3932 catheters. A duration of 6.5 ± 1.7 min was needed for each implant measurement (mean, 17 catheters) plus setup of the EMT system. Data registration based on the DP deviated significantly lower than registration on button centers or fiducial sensors. Within a registration group, there was a <0.5-mm difference in the choice of reference data. Using CT<sub>plan</sub> as reference for registration, the mean residual distance of DPs on EMT-derived DPs was found at 2.1 ± 1.6 mm (EMT<sub>bed</sub>), 1.3 ± 0.9 mm (EMT<sub>CT</sub>), and 2.5 ± 1.5 mm (EMT<sub>F(k)</sub>). CONCLUSIONS: EMT can assess the implant geometry in high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy breast treatments. EMT<sub>bed</sub>, EMT<sub>CT</sub>, and CT<sub>plan</sub> data can serve as reference for assessment of implant changes.},

abstract = {Purpose: To present the implementation of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-planning technique in multi-interstitial perineal and endocavitary gynecological brachytherapy. Material and methods: We used a new fully MRI-compatible applicator that is capable to engage titanium needles, and an intrauterine tandem, developed in our department for the treatment of gynecological cervical cancer patients. This applicator is an attempt to combine the technical advantages of the Martinez universal perineal interstitial template (MUPIT) with the improvement in dose distribution by adding an intrauterine probe with the imaging advantages of MRI-based brachytherapy, thus preserving the stability, geometry, and robustness of the implant, avoiding possible errors of free-hand needle placement. A pre-brachytherapy MRI T2 acquisition is carried out with the template in place 3-5 days before the implant. On this image set, clinical target volume (CTV) is drawn. The required needles and their depths are selected accordingly to encompass the CTV (as conformal as possible). To facilitate this task, a Java based application linked to the treatment planning system has been developed. From this procedure, each needle identification and its depth are obtained previously to the implantation. With this information, the radiation oncologist proceeds with implant and then, a post-implant MRI is carried out, in which the contouring, needles, tandem reconstruction, and optimization are established. Results: This pre-planning procedure has been successfully applied in 10 patients. An excellent reproduction of the virtual pre-planning has been achieved. Conclusions: We describe a virtual pre-planning technique using a multi-interstitial and endocavitary perineal template. It is based on a virtual work with MRI images. This procedure has shown to be feasible and efficient in clinical practice by facilitating the work of specialists, and reducing uncertainties of the application.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence and associated factors of pulmonary seed migration after parotid brachytherapy using a novel migrated seed detection technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients diagnosed with parotid cancer who underwent permanent parotid brachytherapy from January 2006 to December 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Head and neck CT scans and chest X-rays were evaluated during routine follow-up. Mimics software and Geomagic Studio software were used for seed reconstruction and migrated seed detection from the original implanted region, respectively. Postimplant dosimetry analysis was performed after seeds migration if the seeds were still in their emitting count. Adverse clinical sequelae from seed embolization to the lung were documented. RESULTS: The radioactive seed implants were identified on chest X-rays in 6 patients. The incidence rate of seed migration in 321 parotid brachytherapy patients was 1.87% (6/321) and that of individual seed migration was 0.04% (6/15218 seeds). All migrated seeds were originally from the retromandibular region. No adverse dosimetric consequences were found in the target region. Pulmonary symptoms were not reported by any patient in this study. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient set, migration of radioactive seeds with an initial radioactivity of 0.6-0.7 mCi to the chest following parotid brachytherapy was rare. Late migration of a single seed from the central target region did not affect the dosimetry significantly, and patients did not have severe short-term complications. This study proposed a novel technique to localize the anatomical origin of the migrated seeds during brachytherapy. Our evidence suggested that placement of seeds adjacent to blood vessels was associated with an increased likelihood of seed migration to the lungs.},

We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-IBT) in patients with oral cavity cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, 78 patients (49 combined external beam radiotherapy [EBRT] plus IBT and 29 IBT monotherapy) with oral cavity cancers had been treated in our center. Slightly more than half the patients were male, and the median age was 54 years. The treatment was planned based on the Paris system. The main outcomes were disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 36.5 months (range, 1.17-54.23). The actuarial four-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 83% and 65%, respectively. The local and locoregional control was achieved among 89.74% and 87.17% of patients, respectively. None of the factors including tumor size, node status, gender, and radiation modality (IBT alone vs. IBT + EBRT) had a significant statistical correlation to the local control rate. All the patients tolerated the planned treatment in the IBT alone group. Late complications included a case of trismus and three cases of catheter insertion site fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: HDR-IBT as a monotherapy or in combination with EBRT is an appropriate option for the management of oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas, and supports the improvement in treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles in adjuvant settings.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) distortions on a plastic intracavitary/interstitial applicator with plastic needles at a field strength of 3 T and to determine the dosimetric impact, using patient data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 11 cervical cancer patients, our clinical MRI protocol was extended with 3 scans. From the first scan, a multi-echo acquisition, a map of the magnetic field (B<sub>0</sub>) was calculated and used to quantify the field inhomogeneity. The expected displacements of the applicator were quantified for the clinical sequence using the measured field inhomogeneity and the clinical sequence's bandwidth. The second and third scan were our routine clinical sequence (duration: <5 minutes each), acquired consecutively using opposing readout directions. The displacement of the applicator between these scans is approximately twice the displacement due to B<sub>0</sub> inhomogeneity. The impact of the displacement on the dose was determined by reconstructing the applicator on both scans. The applicator was then shifted and rotated the same distance as the observed displacement to create a worst-case scenario (ie, twice the actual displacement due to B<sub>0</sub> inhomogeneity). Next, the dose to 98%/90% (D<sub>98</sub>/D<sub>90</sub>) of the clinical target volume at high risk, as well as the dose to the most irradiated 2 cm<sup>3</sup> for bladder and rectum, were calculated for the original plan as well as the shifted plan. RESULTS: For a volume of interest containing the intrauterine device and the ovoids the 95th percentile of the absolute displacement ranged between 0.2 and 0.75 mm, over all patients. For all patients, the difference in D<sub>98</sub>/D<sub>90</sub> in the opposing readout scans with the original plan was at most 4.7%/4.3%. For the dose to the most irradiated 2 cm<sup>3</sup> of bladder/rectum, the difference was at most 6.0%/6.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The dosimetric impact of distortions on this plastic applicator with plastic needles is limited. Applicator reconstruction for brachytherapy planning purposes is feasible at 3 T MRI.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Online delineation workshops (ODW) permit training of geographically dispersed participants. The purpose is to evaluate the methodology of an ODW using FALCON to harmonize delineation within a European multicentre trial on locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two ODW included 46 clinicians (14 centres). Clinicians completed baseline (C1), guideline (C2) and final contours (C3) for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) for LACC. Interobserver and intraobserver variability was evaluated quantitatively (using the DICE index) and qualitatively compared to expert contours. RESULTS: Nine clinicians submitted for EBRT and BT for C1-C3. Thirty-two sent any contour. Interobserver quantitative comparisons for EBRT showed significant improvement for C2 vs. C1 for bowel, CTV node, CTV-p and GTV node with significant detriment for GTV node (C3 vs. C1; C2), CTV-p (C3 vs. C2) and bowel (C3 vs. C2), showing in general an improvement in C2 vs. C1, with a detriment in C3 vs. C2 for two target volumes and an organ at risk. For BT there was significant improvement for C2 vs. C1 for bladder, GTV, HR-CTV and IR-CTV, with significant detriment for bladder (C3 vs. C2), thus overall improvement in C2 vs. C1, with only a detriment in C3 vs. C2 for bladder. Centres using MRI imaging for BT contouring did significantly better in the BT case for HR-CTV than those which used other techniques (C2 vs. C1: p<0.005; C3 vs. C1: p=0.02). Intraobserver quantitative comparisons showed significant improvement contouring a region of interest between C2 vs. C1, C3 vs. C1 and C3 vs. C2 for EBRT and between C2 and C1 for BT. CONCLUSIONS: ODW offer training, initial contouring harmonization and allow assessment of centres.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment for gynecologic cancers, such as cervical, recurrent endometrial, and vaginal malignancies, commonly includes external-beam radiation and brachytherapy. In high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy, radiation treatment is delivered via hollow needles that are typically inserted through a template on the perineum with a cylinder placed in the vagina for stability. Despite the need for precise needle placement to minimize complications and provide optimal treatment, there is no standard intra-operative image-guidance for this procedure. While some image-guidance techniques have been proposed, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, X-ray computed tomography (CT), and two-dimensional (2D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), these techniques have not been widely adopted. In order to provide intra-operative needle visualization and localization during interstitial brachytherapy, we have developed a three-dimensional (3D) TRUS system. This study describes the 3D TRUS system and reports on the system validation and results from a proof-of-concept patient study. METHODS: To obtain a 3D TRUS image, the system rotates a conventional 2D endocavity transducer through 170 degrees in 12 s, reconstructing the 2D frames into a 3D image in real-time. The geometry of the reconstruction was validated using two geometric phantoms to ensure the accuracy of the linear measurements in each of the image coordinate directions and the volumetric accuracy of the system. An agar phantom including vaginal and rectal canals, as well as a model uterus and tumor, was designed and used to test the visualization and localization of the interstitial needles under idealized conditions by comparing the needles' positions between the 3D TRUS scan and a registered MR image. Five patients undergoing HDR interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy were imaged using the 3D TRUS system following the insertion of all needles. This image was manually, rigidly registered to the clinical postinsertion CT scan based on the vaginal cylinder of the needle template. The positions of the tips and the trajectory of the needle paths were compared between the modalities. RESULTS: The observed geometric errors of the system were ≤ 0.3 mm in each of the three coordinate planes of the 3D US image and the mean measured volumetric error was 0.10 cm<sup>3</sup> . In the phantom study, the mean needle tip difference was 1.54 ± 0.71 mm and the mean trajectory difference was 0.94 ± 0.89 degrees (n = 14). In the in vivo study, a total of 73 needles were placed, of which 88% of needles were visible and 79% of tips were identifiable in the 3D TRUS images. Six of the nine needles that were not visible were due to shadowing artifacts created by the presence of the vaginal cylinder of the needle template. The mean distance between corresponding needle tips in the two modalities was 3.82 ± 1.86 mm and the mean trajectory difference was 3.04 ± 1.63 degrees for the five patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, the 3D TRUS system allowed for localization of needles not obscured by shadowing artifacts, providing a method for visualizing needles intra-operatively during HDR interstitial brachytherapy of gynecologic cancers and providing the potential for 3D image-guidance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with keloids complain of the cosmetic aspect, pain, and pruritus. Many different therapies are being used for keloids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recurrence rate and outcome after resection followed by a single-dose brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated by resection of the keloid plus a single dose of 13 Gy high-dose-rate brachytherapy were evaluated at least 1 year after treatment. Clinical response and cosmesis were assessed by a plastic surgeon and by the patients using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. RESULTS: Only 24 of the 61 invited patients responded to participate with the study; 29 keloids were evaluated. The recurrence rate was 24.1% after a median followup of 53 months (19-95 months). Patients scored on average 24.3 for their total Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale score (range 6-52), whereas the observer scored on average 14.6 (range 6-42). CONCLUSIONS: This treatment has a higher recurrence rate than that reported in most other studies. This may be explained by differences in recurrence definition, differences in followup time among studies, and selection bias because of not contributing to the study. The cosmetic outcome for evaluated patients is relatively good. This treatment policy has the advantage that patients are treated in a single day.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as the imaging modality for image-guided brachytherapy. In locally advanced cervical carcinoma, combined endocavitary and interstitial applicators are appropriate (Vienna or Utrecht). To cover extensive disease, Template Benidorm (TB) was developed. Treatment planning system applicator libraries are currently unavailable for the Utrecht applicator or the TB. The purpose of this work is to develop an applicator library for both applicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The library developed in this work has been used in the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS, version 4.3.0, which has a brachytherapy module that includes a library of rigid applicators. To add the needles of the Utrecht applicator and to model the TB, we used FreeCAD and MeshLab. The reconstruction process was based on the points that the rigid section and the interstitial part have in common. This, together with the free length, allowed us to ascertain the position of the tip. RESULTS: In case of the Utrecht applicator, one of the sources of uncertainty in the reconstruction was determining the distance of the tip of needle from the ovoid. In case of the TB, the large number of needles involved made their identification time consuming. The developed library resolved both issues. CONCLUSIONS: The developed library for the Utrecht and TB is feasible and efficient improving accuracy. It allows all the required treatment planning to proceed using just a T2 MRI sequence. The additional use of specific free available software applications makes it possible to add this information to the already existing library of the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS. Specific details not included on this manuscript will be available under request. This library is also currently being implemented also into the Sagiplan v 2.0 TPS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgically excised keloids reportedly recur at a rate of >45%. Post-excision radiation (RT) has been delivered via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Despite historical data showing 10% to 20% keloid recurrences with post-excision RT, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence comparing keloid recurrences between the two RT modalities. OBJECTIVES: We performed the largest single-institution case-control retrospective study (2004-2014) of keloid recurrence rates and complications between post-excision EBRT and HDR brachytherapy. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty-eight patients, with 264 keloid lesions, were treated by excision alone (n = 28), post-excision EBRT (n = 197), or post-excision HDR brachytherapy (n = 39). Patient and keloid recurrence data were analyzed using mixed effect Cox regression modeling with a statistical threshold of P < .05. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of keloids recurred after surgical excision alone (9-month median follow up); 19% of keloids recurred with post-excision EBRT (42-month median follow up); 23% of keloids recurred with post-excision brachytherapy (12-month median follow up). Adjuvant EBRT and brachytherapy each showed significant control of keloid recurrence compared to excision alone (P < .01). EBRT significantly delayed the time of keloid recurrence over brachytherapy by a mean difference of 2.5 years (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Post-excision RT shows significant reduction in keloid recurrence compared to excision alone. While the recurrence control rates are not statistically different between EBRT and brachytherapy, keloids treated with EBRT recurred significantly later than those treated by HDR brachytherapy by a mean of 2.5 years. Further workup with a randomized control study will help to refine optimal adjuvant RT treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3.},

Ultrasound is an attractive alternative with reasonable costs and high soft tissue depiction quality. This technical note aims to demonstrate the proof of principle for use of TRAns Cervical Endosonography with rotating transducer in the context of brachytherapy (TRACE BT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: TRACE BT presentation is based on a single stage IIB cervical cancer patient. Prior to second BT implant, rotating US transducer (6.9 mm diameter) was inserted in cervical canal and axial images obtained at 10 MHz, focal range of 30 mm, and axial resolution of 0.4 mm. Size and topography of hypo-echoic areas were assessed and optimal positions of interstitial needles were determined. Finally, intracavitary applicator was placed and needles inserted through vaginal ring-template according to TRACE pre-plan. MRI-based high risk clinical target volume (CTVHR) dimensions were compared with hypoechoic areas on TRACE. Topography of parametrial needles on post-insertion MRI was compared with TRACE pre-plan. RESULTS: Insertion of rotating mechanism into cervico-uterine cavity was safe, feasible and fast. The 360° imaging in axial plane enabled real-time assessment of cervix, uterus, and adjacent parametria. Qualitative comparison of TRACE with post-insertion MRI revealed favorable agreement of findings. In-plane size of CTVHR on MRI was comparable to hypoechoic areas on TRACE. Needle positions on post-insertion MRI corresponded to TRACE-based pre-plan. Main limitation of TRACE was gradual deterioration of image quality due to coupling gel removal. CONCLUSIONS: Present proof of concept demonstrates potential role of TRACE-BT for cervical cancer as an attractive high-tech approach with reasonable costs. Prior to investigation of its clinical role, further development of TRACE methodology is needed. This includes reliable transducer-tissue coupling, applicator reconstruction, imaging range, limitations in extensive tumors, US-based contouring concepts, registration with other imaging methods, organ dose-assessment, real-time dosimetry, etc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The ability to create treatment plans for intraoperative high-dose-rate (IOHDR) brachytherapy is limited by lack of imaging and time constraints. An automated method for creation of a library of high-dose-rate brachytherapy plans that can be used with standard planar applicators in the intraoperative setting is highly desirable. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nonnegative least squares algebraic methods were used to identify dwell time values for flat, rectangular planar applicators. The planar applicators ranged in length and width from 2 cm to 25 cm. Plans were optimized to deliver an absorbed dose of 10 Gy to three different depths from the patient surface: 0 cm, 0.5 cm, and 1.0 cm. Software was written to calculate the optimized dwell times and insert dwell times and positions into a .XML plan template that can be imported into the Varian brachytherapy treatment planning system. The user may import the .XML template into the treatment planning system in the intraoperative setting to match the patient applicator size and prescribed treatment depth. RESULTS: A total of 1587 library plans were created for IOHDR brachytherapy. Median plan generation time was approximately 1 minute per plan. Plan dose was typically 100% ± 1% (mean, standard deviation) of the prescribed dose over the entire length and width of the applicator. Plan uniformity was best for prescription depths of 0 cm and 0.5 cm from the patient surface. CONCLUSIONS: An IOHDR plan library may be created using automated methods. Thousands of plan templates may be optimized and prepared in a few hours to accommodate different applicator sizes and treatment depths and reduce treatment planning time. The automated method also enforces dwell time symmetry for symmetrical applicator geometries, which simplifies quality assurance.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance images were acquired with six different catheter-filling materials-water, glucose 50%, saline, olive oil, glycerin, and copper sulfate (CuSO4) water solution (2.08 g/L)-inserted into compatible computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ring applicators placed in a phantom made of gelatin and CuSO4. The best contrast media were tested in four patients with the applicators in place. RESULTS: In T2-weighted sequences, the best contrast was achieved with the CuSO4-filled catheters, followed by saline- and glycerin-filled catheters, which presented poor visualization. In addition (also in T2-weighted sequences), CuSO4 presented better contrast when tested in the phantom than when tested in the patients, in which it provided some contrast but with poor identification of the first dwell position, mainly in the ring. CONCLUSION: We found CuSO4 to be the best solution for visualization of the applicator channels, mainly in T2-weighted images in vitro, although the materials tested presented low signal intensity in the images obtained in vivo, as well as poor precision in determining the first dwell position.},
