abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast enabling the contouring of targets and organs at risk (OARs) during gynecological interstitial brachytherapy procedure. Despite its benefit, one of the main challenges toward MRI-only workflows is that the implanted catheters are not reliably visualized on MR images. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of MR-only workflow using an in-house MR line marker during interstitial gynecological high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients diagnosed with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with HDR brachytherapy were included in this study. The hybrid CT/MR-treated plan was used as the study reference plan. Five users manually reconstructed the catheter's path on MR images (3D T1- and T2-weighted). Subsequently, the dwell positions from the users' plans were superimposed on the reference plans to evaluate the dosimetric impact of the using MR-only for catheter reconstruction in comparison with hybrid CT/MR approach. Variability of dwell positions between users and reconstruction time was also evaluated. RESULTS: More than 96.90% of catheter reconstruction variations were < 2 mm. No statistical differences were reported between MR-only and hybrid CT/MR in gross tumor volume D<sub>98</sub> and high-risk clinical target volume D<sub>90</sub>, respectively. For the OARs (bladder, sigmoid, rectum, and bowel), no significant changes were observed in any dose metrics between MR-only and hybrid CT/MR. The average reconstruction time was 51 ± 10 minutes across all ten patients. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of MR-only workflow using MR line marker during interstitial gynecological HDR brachytherapy has been validated in this study. The results show that the MR-only workflow is equivalent to the conventional hybrid CT/MR approach in terms of gross tumor volume and high-risk clinical target volume coverage and respecting of OARs dose limits.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Eliminating patient computed tomography (CT) scans for tandem and ring (T&R) brachytherapy can reduce overall procedure time and eliminates imaging dose. However, reconstructing titanium applicators in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging. We evaluated the uncertainty of different applicator reconstruction workflows in MR-guided brachytherapy, and assessed the clinical impact of reconstruction uncertainties. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Titanium MRI-compatible T&Rs with aqueous gel in the buildup cap were reconstructed on CTs and MRIs to assess the uncertainties of four different workflows. Reconstruction was performed using (1) proton density-weighted MRIs with solid applicator from a library, (2) applicator-only reference CT fused with MRIs, (3) T2-weighted (T2W) MRIs following GEC-ESTRO guidelines, and (4) patient CTs fused with patient MRIs with in situ applicators. We evaluated dwell positions and plan quality differences using high-risk clinical target volume coverage, and EQD2 D<sub>2cc</sub> of rectum, sigmoid, bladder, and small bowel. RESULTS: The 2σ uncertainty for dwell positions for each workflow were (1) 2.7 mm for both ring and tandem, (2) 1.4 mm ring and 0.8 mm tandem, (3) 0.2 mm ring and 0.8 mm tandem, and (4) 1.9 mm ring and 0.4 mm tandem. Reconstruction uncertainties resulted in dose variations within acceptable levels (below 10%) except for (1) which resulted in larger dose to the rectum (20%). Dose uncertainties were similar between reference CT and patient CT. CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction with a reference CT results in similar uncertainty to a patient CT. T2W MRI plans have acceptable uncertainty levels for the applicator reconstruction and resulting dose distributions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The MRI-guided cervical cancer brachytherapy provides unparalleled soft-tissue contrast for target and normal tissue contouring, but eliminates the ability to use conventional metallic fiducials for radiation source path reconstruction as required for treatment planning. Instead, the source path is reconstructed by manually aligning a library model to the signal void produced by the applicator, which takes time intraoperatively and precludes fully automated treatment planning. The purpose of this study is to present and validate an algorithm to automatically reconstruct tandem and ring applicators using MRI for cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. METHODS: Applicators were reconstructed using T2-weighted MR images acquired at 1.5 T from 33 brachytherapy fractions including 10 patients using a model-to-image registration algorithm. The algorithm involves (a) image filtering and maximum intensity projection to highlight the applicator, (b) ring center identification using the circular Hough transform, and (c) three-dimensional surface model registration, optimized by maximizing the image intensity gradient normal to the model surface. Two independent observers manually reconstructed all applicators, enabling the calculation of interobserver variability and establishing a ground truth. Algorithm variability was calculated by comparing algorithm results to each individual observer, and algorithm accuracy was calculated by comparing algorithm results to the ground truth. The algorithm variability and accuracy were compared to the interobserver variability using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Mean ± SD interobserver variability was 0.83 ± 0.31 mm and 0.78 ± 0.29 mm for the ring and tandem, respectively. The algorithm had mean ± SD variability and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.32 mm (P = 0.02) and 0.60 ± 0.24 mm (P = 0.0005) for the ring, and 0.70 ± 0.29 mm (P = 0.11) and 0.58 ± 0.24 mm (P = 0.004) for the tandem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm variability and accuracy were within the interobserver variability measured in this study. The algorithm accuracy and mean execution time of 10.0 s are sufficient for clinical tandem and ring reconstruction, and are a step toward fully automated tandem and ring brachytherapy treatment planning.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brachytherapy involves placement of radioactive sources inside or near the tumour. For gynaecological cancer, recent developments, including 3D imaging and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy, have improved treatment quality and outcomes. However, for large or complex tumours, target coverage and local control with commercially available applicators remain suboptimal. Moreover, side effects are frequent and impact on quality of life. This signifies that brachytherapy treatment conformity can improve. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop 3D printed personalised brachytherapy applicators with a custom vaginal topography and guided needle source channels, based on the patients' anatomy. METHODS: Customised applicators were derived from MRI data of two gynaecological cancer patients. Needle channels were planned by the Radiation Oncologist during image segmentation. Applicators contained multi-curved channels for 6F needles (ProGuide, Elekta) and were manufactured using a digital light processing-based 3D printer. Needle channel radius constraints were measured by analysing needle insertion forces in a 3D printed template, and imposed on the designs. RESULTS: Two customised needle applicators are presented. Interstitial needle channels have tapered ends to increase needle protrusion angle accuracy. Additional structures were included to serve as anchor points in MR images for applicator and needle modelling and reconstruction during treatment planning. An insertion force analysis yielded a radius constraint of 35 mm to minimise the risk on needle jamming or buckling. For radii larger than 50 mm, no differences in insertion forces were found. CONCLUSION: A novel method to design and produce vaginal topography-based 3D prints for personalised brachytherapy applicators, derived from patient MRI data, is presented. The applicators include curved needle channels that can be used for intracavitary and guided interstitial needle placement. Further spatial optimisation of brachytherapy source channels to the patient anatomy is expected to increase brachytherapy conformity and outcome.},

abstract = {Purpose: To present the implementation of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-planning technique in multi-interstitial perineal and endocavitary gynecological brachytherapy. Material and methods: We used a new fully MRI-compatible applicator that is capable to engage titanium needles, and an intrauterine tandem, developed in our department for the treatment of gynecological cervical cancer patients. This applicator is an attempt to combine the technical advantages of the Martinez universal perineal interstitial template (MUPIT) with the improvement in dose distribution by adding an intrauterine probe with the imaging advantages of MRI-based brachytherapy, thus preserving the stability, geometry, and robustness of the implant, avoiding possible errors of free-hand needle placement. A pre-brachytherapy MRI T2 acquisition is carried out with the template in place 3-5 days before the implant. On this image set, clinical target volume (CTV) is drawn. The required needles and their depths are selected accordingly to encompass the CTV (as conformal as possible). To facilitate this task, a Java based application linked to the treatment planning system has been developed. From this procedure, each needle identification and its depth are obtained previously to the implantation. With this information, the radiation oncologist proceeds with implant and then, a post-implant MRI is carried out, in which the contouring, needles, tandem reconstruction, and optimization are established. Results: This pre-planning procedure has been successfully applied in 10 patients. An excellent reproduction of the virtual pre-planning has been achieved. Conclusions: We describe a virtual pre-planning technique using a multi-interstitial and endocavitary perineal template. It is based on a virtual work with MRI images. This procedure has shown to be feasible and efficient in clinical practice by facilitating the work of specialists, and reducing uncertainties of the application.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) distortions on a plastic intracavitary/interstitial applicator with plastic needles at a field strength of 3 T and to determine the dosimetric impact, using patient data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 11 cervical cancer patients, our clinical MRI protocol was extended with 3 scans. From the first scan, a multi-echo acquisition, a map of the magnetic field (B<sub>0</sub>) was calculated and used to quantify the field inhomogeneity. The expected displacements of the applicator were quantified for the clinical sequence using the measured field inhomogeneity and the clinical sequence's bandwidth. The second and third scan were our routine clinical sequence (duration: <5 minutes each), acquired consecutively using opposing readout directions. The displacement of the applicator between these scans is approximately twice the displacement due to B<sub>0</sub> inhomogeneity. The impact of the displacement on the dose was determined by reconstructing the applicator on both scans. The applicator was then shifted and rotated the same distance as the observed displacement to create a worst-case scenario (ie, twice the actual displacement due to B<sub>0</sub> inhomogeneity). Next, the dose to 98%/90% (D<sub>98</sub>/D<sub>90</sub>) of the clinical target volume at high risk, as well as the dose to the most irradiated 2 cm<sup>3</sup> for bladder and rectum, were calculated for the original plan as well as the shifted plan. RESULTS: For a volume of interest containing the intrauterine device and the ovoids the 95th percentile of the absolute displacement ranged between 0.2 and 0.75 mm, over all patients. For all patients, the difference in D<sub>98</sub>/D<sub>90</sub> in the opposing readout scans with the original plan was at most 4.7%/4.3%. For the dose to the most irradiated 2 cm<sup>3</sup> of bladder/rectum, the difference was at most 6.0%/6.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The dosimetric impact of distortions on this plastic applicator with plastic needles is limited. Applicator reconstruction for brachytherapy planning purposes is feasible at 3 T MRI.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment for gynecologic cancers, such as cervical, recurrent endometrial, and vaginal malignancies, commonly includes external-beam radiation and brachytherapy. In high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy, radiation treatment is delivered via hollow needles that are typically inserted through a template on the perineum with a cylinder placed in the vagina for stability. Despite the need for precise needle placement to minimize complications and provide optimal treatment, there is no standard intra-operative image-guidance for this procedure. While some image-guidance techniques have been proposed, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, X-ray computed tomography (CT), and two-dimensional (2D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), these techniques have not been widely adopted. In order to provide intra-operative needle visualization and localization during interstitial brachytherapy, we have developed a three-dimensional (3D) TRUS system. This study describes the 3D TRUS system and reports on the system validation and results from a proof-of-concept patient study. METHODS: To obtain a 3D TRUS image, the system rotates a conventional 2D endocavity transducer through 170 degrees in 12 s, reconstructing the 2D frames into a 3D image in real-time. The geometry of the reconstruction was validated using two geometric phantoms to ensure the accuracy of the linear measurements in each of the image coordinate directions and the volumetric accuracy of the system. An agar phantom including vaginal and rectal canals, as well as a model uterus and tumor, was designed and used to test the visualization and localization of the interstitial needles under idealized conditions by comparing the needles' positions between the 3D TRUS scan and a registered MR image. Five patients undergoing HDR interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy were imaged using the 3D TRUS system following the insertion of all needles. This image was manually, rigidly registered to the clinical postinsertion CT scan based on the vaginal cylinder of the needle template. The positions of the tips and the trajectory of the needle paths were compared between the modalities. RESULTS: The observed geometric errors of the system were ≤ 0.3 mm in each of the three coordinate planes of the 3D US image and the mean measured volumetric error was 0.10 cm<sup>3</sup> . In the phantom study, the mean needle tip difference was 1.54 ± 0.71 mm and the mean trajectory difference was 0.94 ± 0.89 degrees (n = 14). In the in vivo study, a total of 73 needles were placed, of which 88% of needles were visible and 79% of tips were identifiable in the 3D TRUS images. Six of the nine needles that were not visible were due to shadowing artifacts created by the presence of the vaginal cylinder of the needle template. The mean distance between corresponding needle tips in the two modalities was 3.82 ± 1.86 mm and the mean trajectory difference was 3.04 ± 1.63 degrees for the five patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, the 3D TRUS system allowed for localization of needles not obscured by shadowing artifacts, providing a method for visualizing needles intra-operatively during HDR interstitial brachytherapy of gynecologic cancers and providing the potential for 3D image-guidance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as the imaging modality for image-guided brachytherapy. In locally advanced cervical carcinoma, combined endocavitary and interstitial applicators are appropriate (Vienna or Utrecht). To cover extensive disease, Template Benidorm (TB) was developed. Treatment planning system applicator libraries are currently unavailable for the Utrecht applicator or the TB. The purpose of this work is to develop an applicator library for both applicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The library developed in this work has been used in the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS, version 4.3.0, which has a brachytherapy module that includes a library of rigid applicators. To add the needles of the Utrecht applicator and to model the TB, we used FreeCAD and MeshLab. The reconstruction process was based on the points that the rigid section and the interstitial part have in common. This, together with the free length, allowed us to ascertain the position of the tip. RESULTS: In case of the Utrecht applicator, one of the sources of uncertainty in the reconstruction was determining the distance of the tip of needle from the ovoid. In case of the TB, the large number of needles involved made their identification time consuming. The developed library resolved both issues. CONCLUSIONS: The developed library for the Utrecht and TB is feasible and efficient improving accuracy. It allows all the required treatment planning to proceed using just a T2 MRI sequence. The additional use of specific free available software applications makes it possible to add this information to the already existing library of the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS. Specific details not included on this manuscript will be available under request. This library is also currently being implemented also into the Sagiplan v 2.0 TPS.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for image guided adaptive brachytherapy (BT) of cervical cancer. Ultrasound is an attractive alternative with reasonable costs and high soft tissue depiction quality. This technical note aims to demonstrate the proof of principle for use of TRAns Cervical Endosonography with rotating transducer in the context of brachytherapy (TRACE BT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: TRACE BT presentation is based on a single stage IIB cervical cancer patient. Prior to second BT implant, rotating US transducer (6.9 mm diameter) was inserted in cervical canal and axial images obtained at 10 MHz, focal range of 30 mm, and axial resolution of 0.4 mm. Size and topography of hypo-echoic areas were assessed and optimal positions of interstitial needles were determined. Finally, intracavitary applicator was placed and needles inserted through vaginal ring-template according to TRACE pre-plan. MRI-based high risk clinical target volume (CTVHR) dimensions were compared with hypoechoic areas on TRACE. Topography of parametrial needles on post-insertion MRI was compared with TRACE pre-plan. RESULTS: Insertion of rotating mechanism into cervico-uterine cavity was safe, feasible and fast. The 360° imaging in axial plane enabled real-time assessment of cervix, uterus, and adjacent parametria. Qualitative comparison of TRACE with post-insertion MRI revealed favorable agreement of findings. In-plane size of CTVHR on MRI was comparable to hypoechoic areas on TRACE. Needle positions on post-insertion MRI corresponded to TRACE-based pre-plan. Main limitation of TRACE was gradual deterioration of image quality due to coupling gel removal. CONCLUSIONS: Present proof of concept demonstrates potential role of TRACE-BT for cervical cancer as an attractive high-tech approach with reasonable costs. Prior to investigation of its clinical role, further development of TRACE methodology is needed. This includes reliable transducer-tissue coupling, applicator reconstruction, imaging range, limitations in extensive tumors, US-based contouring concepts, registration with other imaging methods, organ dose-assessment, real-time dosimetry, etc.},
