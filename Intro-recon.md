# Applicator reconstruction

Determining the source path and the most distal dwell position are the catheter reconstruction
objectives. The CT dummies design that allows reconstruction of brachytherapy source
channels is easy, and all vendors include them in their product catalogs. By contrast,
applicator reconstruction is more challenging when MRI is used and even more so in T2-
weighted sequences. The materials visible in MRI are usually liquids, and this limits the
construction diameter of the dummy. Some solutions are available for the intracavitary part<sup>14</sup> and more recently for needles too<sup>2</sup>. The determination of the most distal dwell position involves an extra
challenge due to the finite slice thickness. A possible solution is to add reconstructed images
between two slice thicknesses, which reduces the uncertainty in the searched position.

An alternative to this modality of reconstruction is the use of applicator libraries. The
applicator libraries contain accurate 3d models of the applicators. Once the implanted model
has been selected, we find a transformation that matches it on the image. Once the applicator
is in place, both the source path and the most distal dwell position are well determined. The
method is only valid for rigid applicators and, therefore, excludes the interstitial part.
